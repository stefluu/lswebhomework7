# Homework #7

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Array: 
	An array is a data type in Javascript that is a collection of information. Some real-life collection examples are collecting stickers, tsum tsums, catching pokemon on Pokemon Go.  These are all collections of similar items. We can also collect things that aren't similar. For example, maybe we want to collect action hero-themed items. This might contain all sorts of items: clothing, toys, stickers, comics. Arrays in Javascript are like these collections, except with data and values. They can contain all the same data types, (like if you collected only stickers), or different data types, (like if you collected action hero-themed items that aren't all the same type of items). Arrays can also contain functions in its collection.  A function is code that is remembered and action-provoking. A function is a remembered "action" code in an array, which is similar to a remembered physical action in real life. Similar to how your body has muscle memory for actions, arrays have functions for actions. We store these functions and their "actions" in an array like we store physical actions in our muscle memory.  Our muscle memory might store many actions, just like an array can store many functions.
	
	* Object: 
	An object is a named collection of values, properties, and methods. A real-life example of an object can be compared to a pet. A pet has many characteristics. For example, a pet can be many types of animals. "Type" is a characteristic of the pet.  "Dog" can be the kind of "type" of pet. Therefore, if we were to write this in Javascript, "pet" would be the object name, "type" would be a property name or key, and "dog" would be the value assigned to the property of "type".
	
	
	* Method:
	A function within an object is known as a method.  Let's use the pet example from before. A real life example of an object method is if the pet knows a trick. Knowing a trick is a characteristic of the pet, and there is an action associated with the trick. Therefore in Javascript, "trick" would be the property name, and the action of the trick is the "method".
